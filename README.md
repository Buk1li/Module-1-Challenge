# Challenge for Module 1 of the U of U bootcamp

After taking the starter code from GitHub - coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram , I reformatted the code to match the acceptance criteria. I also streamlined some of the code to remove redundancies so that the code was a bit smaller, which should decrease the file size.

There was some initial hesitation on my part with editing the starter code, but overall it was a good experience to get comfortable with making changes and being confident in my vision of what I wanted to do with the code.
